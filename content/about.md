# About

Brother Bemused is the allonym of Jim Hannah, for whom, as one friend said,
"words are but a plaything." He's retired now after decades of word play as a
journalist and editor, but still on occasion scratches the itch to write.
Usually this compulsion stems from bewilderment about the human condition,
hence the moniker bemused: "to cause to be mildly or wryly amused."
