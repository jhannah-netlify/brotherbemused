Within the week we hopefully will know the outcome of what seems to me “the
most consequential presidential election of my lifetime.” While that phrase may
sound like typical election hyperbole, the growing sense of angst I feel is due
to what I see as a national identity crisis. Who are we, really? 
<!-- excerpt -->

That question will not be answered fully by this election outcome, but it will
surely reveal how a record number of voters cast their ballot to express who we
are, and to shape who we want to become. I’ve not known an election when so
many choices have been so clearly delineated:

Will abortion decisions be made by women and physicians, or by legislators and
judges?

Will we establish Christianity as the national religion, either implicitly or
explicitly? 

Will hopeful immigrants find here an asylum of welcome and opportunity, or a
wall of rejection and mass deportation? 

Will participants in the Capitol riot of January 6,2020 be exonerated as
patriots, or will they face the consequences of insurrection and violence?

Will the standard of “no one is above the law” be upheld, or dismantled?

Will we affirm the national motto of e pluribus unum, or will we discourage
diversity and dissent? 

Will we align ourselves internationally with democracies, or with despots? 

Will we retain a balance of power between the three branches of government, or
will the executive branch subsume the legislative and judicial? 

Will our response to global warming be one of awareness and action, or denial
and delay? 

Will we uphold, or withdraw, from our international partnerships and our
identity as global citizens?

Will we welcome, or suppress, forthright assessments of our national history?

Will the new administration institute loyalty tests, or model itself on
Lincoln’s diverse “team of rivals” approach?

Granted, there’s no such thing as a neutral question. And these questions are
admittedly binary. Life is much more yes/and, than either/or. And when posed in
such black-and-white terms it’s evident that there’s a vast grey area between
the extremes.

Nonetheless, these questions have helped me consider the trend lines they
reveal. 

Who are we, and who do we want to become? 

It may sound odd to ask such questions as our nation nears its 250th birthday,
but it seems to me we’re in a midlife crisis. This all too often leads to some
very poor life decisions. I can only hope that the angst I now feel will in the
long run be remembered as growing pains.
