Gobsmacked by the beauty of the October Glory maple in our front yard.

Puts me in mind of a poem by Gordon & Gladis DePree:

> Some wordless whisper reaches out to me<br/>
> to ask secrets of the trees along the road,<br/>
> To ask them how bark and leaf<br/>
> re related to skin and bone,<br/>
> And how the change was made,<br/>
> Or of the tie ever existed<br/>
> between sap and blood.
