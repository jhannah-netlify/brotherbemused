As a word person, I’m fascinated (and often frustrated) by the way words get
co-opted, coming to mean the opposite of their original intent.

Take the current lingo that describes something really good as really “bad.”
What’s with that? Good wasn’t good enough?

Or how about when someone says, ”Oh, that’s just perfect,” when what they
actually mean is “that’s just wrong.” Again, what’s wrong with just saying
wrong? Come on, people.

I think I was first sensitized to this phenomenon years ago by reading 1984,
with its its description of doublespeak and the nonsense of sentences like
“Love is hate.”

It seems to me something similar is going on these days with the term
“Christian nationalism.” In my view, these two words should never be co-joined.
The fact that they are increasingly in bed together has resulted in a host of
illegitimate offspring, with names like Misogyny and Xenophobia.

To me, legitimate use of the term “Christian” would be limited to beliefs and
behaviors reflective of the life and ministry of its namesake, Jesus Christ.

What might be the Top Ten words describing Jesus? Inclusion would surely be
one. Compassion. Justice. Peace. Mercy. The Be-attitudes that open Jesus’
Sermon on the Mount are a great summary, and a guide for Jesus people
([Matthew 5-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5-7&version=NIV)).

But these Jesus values are at variance with much of “Christian nationalism,”
which seems often more about exclusion, power, and control. Some extreme
expressions envision a more “muscular” Jesus whose Second Coming will set
things in order, much like the Zealots in Jesus’ day who looked for a messiah
to reign supreme with God’s elect.

But such power politics miss the point of Jesus’ “power with,” rather than
“power over.” The Domination Systems of this world are now, and ever have been,
at variance with the power of Love and the inclusive Kin-dom of God.

Also not to be overlooked is the fact that “Christian nationalism” is
un-Constitutional. This nation was founded with a secular government, certainly
informed by Christian beliefs, but with a Constitution intentionally designed
with no direct reference to a Christian God, and prohibiting the establishment
of any one religion in order to protect the religious freedoms of ALL.

So I’m inclined to abbreviate “Christian nationalism” and just call it what it
is: nationalism, defined by American Heritage dictionary as ”Devotion,
especially excessive or undiscriminating devotion, to the interest or culture
of a particular nation-state; the belief that nations will benefit formatting
independently rather than collectively, emphasizing national rather than
international goals.”

How about, in the spirit of un-co-opting, we just leave Jesus and Christians
out of it?
