"Historians who study social movements worldwide have coined the term "3.5%
rule" -- that throughout history, few authoritarian governments have withstood
3.5% of their population peacefully mobilized against them in a sustained way."

Per [MoveOn.org](https://front.moveon.org/), the recent No Kings rallies
sponsored by Indivisible numbered some 5 million protestors at 2,100 events,
adding that the 3.5% rule "helps us understand just how big our movement needs
to get to stop Trump's tyranny -- on the order of more than 11 million people
showing up again and again."

How about next time, and the times after, we "each one bring one?"

## June 20 update

HOPEFUL NEWS: CBS reports that "Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are
looking to limit President Trump's ability to order U.S. strikes on Iran amid
its ongoing war with Israel, emphasizing that only Congress has the power to
declare war under the Constitution." Where is the resolution by which Congress
has granted to President Trump the authority to bomb Iran? Meanwhile, the
entire world holds its breath awaiting the decision of one man regarding the
fate of the Middle East, and possibly the globe itself.
