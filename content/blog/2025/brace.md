That’s the best three-word summary I’ve yet heard for the days ahead under a
new administration, expressed by NY Times columnist
[Patrick Healy](https://archive.is/C0nx9).

<!-- excerpt -->

As we try to keep our heads down and our chins up, wondering how we got here and how it may end, here’s a short list of hazards we probably should have paid more attention to before boarding:
* Narcissistic personality disorder. 
* Lessons from the Gilded Age and the Robber Barons.
* The wedding of religion and nationalism.
* Appreciation for civics (and its cousin, civility).
* Logic and reason.
* The common good.
* Media manipulation.

I think it’s pretty safe to say that “unprecedented” will characterize much of
what will transpire in the days ahead. 

I wish I could forecast what historians may write decades hence about these
times, but I won’t be around by then. 

Meanwhile, I’m buckling up, trying to comfort myself and loved ones, holding on
tight for a soft landing in hopes of arriving at that “more perfect union” our
ancestors dared believe was possible.
