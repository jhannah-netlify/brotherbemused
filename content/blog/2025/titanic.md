I increasingly feel like a passenger on the doomed Titanic as our co-captains
order “Full speed ahead!” in disregard of icebergs evident all around. I’ve
even wondered if the Trump/Musk duo are intentionally trying to sink our ship
of state.

<!-- excerpt -->

Crazy thinking, right? But what about the crazy-making course they’re charting?
Make enemies of our allies, and friends of our enemies? Elevate the executive
branch to undermine the Constitutional balance of power? Further enflame our
culture wars by retribution? Attack the free press as “enemies of the people?”
Purge bedrock values of diversity, equity, and inclusion? Impose broad-scale
tariffs that spark no-win trade wars? Fire federal employees indiscriminately,
by the tens of thousands?

So I sometimes have this sinking feeling. I wonder how many of us will be
fortunate enough to make it to a lifeboat. I wonder who will respond to our
distress calls, having alienated our friends. I wonder what tune the dance band
will strike up as the ship slips beneath the waves. 

But wait! Maybe all is not lost. This week an urgent message from Chief Justice
Roberts, signaled that attacking and impeaching federal judges is straying off
course. And the highest-ranking security folks (both Republican and Democrat)
sent “Slow down!” messages, saying precipitous changes to international
alliances could diminish our national security. 

Coupled with urgent messages being sent by farmers injured by tariffs, veterans
impacted by VA cutbacks, construction firms impacted by mass deportations, etc.
…well, hopefully the old ship of state that has weathered nearly 250 seasons
will right itself once the squall passes. 

No doubt a course correction is overdue regarding the national debt,
immigration policies, foreign affairs, and so forth. But surgical removal of
“waste, abuse, and fraud” wouldn’t require a chainsaw. That’s like cutting down
a tree to trim some dead branches. 

Ploughing straight ahead, ignoring counsel, and trying to set a speed record
were all elements that sank the Titanic. Please, let’s not go there again.
