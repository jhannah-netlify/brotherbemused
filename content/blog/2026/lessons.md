In 1968, eminent historians Will and Ariel Durant sounded a prescient word of
caution in their book, The Lessons of History. 

A democracy can be undermined, they wrote:

> If war continues to absorb and dominate it, or if the itch to rule the world
requires a large military establishment and appropriation, the freedoms of
democracy may one by one succumb to the discipline of arms and strife. If
race or class war divides us into hostile camps, changing political arguments
into blind hate, one side or the other may overturn the hustings with the
rule of the sword. If our economy of freedom fails to distribute wealth as
ably as it has created it, the road to dictatorship will be open to any man
who can persuasively promise security to all; and a martial government, under
whatever charming phrases, will engulf the democratic world (pp. 79-80).

These observations of nearly 60 years ago echo George Santayana's original
quote, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."
Hopefully we'll learn from the past, rather than attempt to ignore or deny
it.....???
