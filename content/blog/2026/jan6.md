LEST WE FORGET: JANUARY 6, 2021... As efforts increase to whitewash or erase
the always-checkered history of our nation, PBS News Hour has offered a
tremendous service by documenting in-depth the events of January 6 -- the
lead-up, the day itself, and the aftermath. 

In our post-fact, post-truth environs these days, you can see for yourself
the riot and its intent. I hope millions will view this coverage and
re-dedicate themselves to the ideals of democracy that US citizens have long
pledged to uphold--allegiance to liberty and justice for ALL. Here's one of
many links:
