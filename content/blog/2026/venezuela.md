In light of the administration's Venezuelan misadventure I offer this thought
exercise:

What would be the US response if another nation were to determine that
President Trump is a war criminal, issued a warrant for his arrest, and in a
military exercise knocked out our defense system, killed 60 Secret Service
personnel and used flash grenades in the White House, capturing the president
and his wife, flying them out of the country for trial?

And what if that country explained their incursion of a sovereign state by
describing it not as an act of war but as a legal "law enforcement action?'

And a final question, If our administration's actions in Venezuela were as
righteous and justifiable as some claim, couldn't any other nation use the same
argument to justify their invasion of the US? By international law and
long-held custom, a preemptive attack on a sovereign nation is illegal and an
act of war.

"American exceptionalism" is no exception.
