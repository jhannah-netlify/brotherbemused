Back when I was a pup I grooved to The Temptation’s tune asking,
“War! What is it good for?”

The answer they offered was “ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!”

Now that I’m an old dog, however, I beg to differ.

War is good for *lots* of things. 

War is good for silencing dissent. Once war is declared, questioning it is
branded unpatriotic, disloyal, dangerous.

War is good for enemy-making. Once one dehumanizes “the other,” there is
neither guilt nor shame in killing the sub-human, the enemy. It’s us or “them.”

War is good for stirring up emotions like “my country right or wrong,” and can
foster a heightened sense of patriotism to make killing noble, even glorious. 

War is good for skirting personal responsibility, even for war crimes. The
combatants are, after all, only acting on behalf of the state, under orders. 

War is good for Orwellian doublespeak: “love is hate,” “we had to destroy the
village to save it,” “peace through strength,” etc. 

War is good for “saving the ________ way of life.” (Fill in the blank with your
nation’s name.) 

War is good for training combat field surgeons, who learn how to treat patients
with massive and multiple injuries, in quantities they might never have seen in
civilian life.

War is good for eliciting the most noble of human attributes: courage,
sacrifice, idealism, and the willingness to die for the cause, or die for a
comrade in arms. 

War is good for the economy as demand increases for flags, coffins,
prosthetics, weapons, uniforms, drugs, propaganda, and everything else needed
for the war machine.     

War is good for the coffers of the
military / corporate / educational / entertainment / religion / media / government
complex—a cabal that has expanded immensely since Eisenhower cautioned against
the “military industrial complex” and war profiteering.

War is good for settling any questions about the global pecking order, who has
the biggest stick, and other testosterone-driven questions of mastery. 

Yes, war is good. So good, in fact, what not make it endless? 

Oh, you say it already is?  

Then we should have world peace any day now.
