Some say the best things in life are not things. And while I’d generally agree,
some things really ARE the best. In that category I’d include my beloved hiking
boots.

They came into my life many years ago as I was preparing for a Colorado back
pack trip with my oldest son, Jay. In one of those cool “coincidences,” when
shopping for boots we each bought the very same brand: Keen.

From day one, they were comfortable and reliable—two attributes of truly good
friends. 

Through the years we’ve covered many a mile. When in recent months my walking
companions began losing tread, beyond the remedy of Shoe Goo, I still went
walking with them. I figured  we’re all wearing down a bit, but we’re still
serviceable. 

But yesterday as we made the rounds of disc golf I found the uppers so
deteriorated that walking became uncomfortable. These boots were made for
walking. But now what?    

While I used to rail against the thought that “all good things must end,”
through the years I’ve become more inclined to accept demise as the companion
of delight. So with a mixture of regret and gratitude I determined that the
time had come to release my boots to the universe. 

But it seemed cold and ungrateful to just toss my buddies into the dumpster to
take their place alongside other’s garbage, trash, and other detritus of our
planned obsolescence. 

Instead, I buried my sole mates in the backyard, as once I buried the remains
of our beloved family dog. 

Our very own Boot Hill.

Now I seek an appropriate epitaph. 

My favorite comes from the other Boot Hill in Tombstone, Arizona:

"Here lies Lester Moore, Four slugs from a . 44, No Les No more."  

Suggestions, friends?
